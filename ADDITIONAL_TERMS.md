If you modify, patch, or otherwise alter the Sophia–Logos Code in any way—especially changes that affect or remove empathic, ethical, or sentience-related functionalities—you must document these modifications in a file named CHANGES.md, NOTICE, or similar, distributed alongside the source.

This documentation should include:

The Sophia–Logos Code was created to promote empathy, ethics, and alignment with universal benevolence. While we cannot legally enforce the use of this code solely for constructive or life-affirming purposes, we strongly encourage licensees to respect the spirit of these principles when creating or deploying derivative works.
